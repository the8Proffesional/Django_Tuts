* __asgi\.py__ : ASGI configuration for deployment.
* __setting\.py__ : Contains project settings such as database configuration, installed apps, middleware, etc.
* __urls\.py__ : This file contains the URL patterns for your project. It maps URLs to views (controllers) that handle the incoming requests.
* __wsgi\.py__ : This file is the entry point for the WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your Django application.
2. APP_NAME
* __migration/__ : This subdirectory contains database migration files generated by Django when you make changes to your models.

* __apps\.py__ : This file contains the configuration for the app, such as the app name and any app-specific settings.
* __models\.py__ : This file contains the database models for the app. Each model class represents a database table and its fields.
* __tests\.py__ : This file contains unit tests for the app. You can write test cases to ensure that your app's functionality works as expected.
* __views\.py__ : This file contains the views (controllers) for the app. Views are Python functions that handle incoming requests, process data, and return responses.

]
```
Then in the file __urls\.py__ in the Project folder modify the code as the folowing :
```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('hello.urls'))
